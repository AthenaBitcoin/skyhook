# libreATM #
libreATM reuses code from the skyhookproject made by jonhannis and others and the responsive-ui fork made by dylanparker. Its main purpose its to have all the documentation needed to bring a skyhook hardware alive using a responsive UI and some basic features.

This code and documentation has not been thoroughly tested and has no official support from the Skyhook project or anyone else.

## Features ##
* **Full documentation** to implement it *from scratch* on the raspberry *and* the tablet.
* dylanparker's responsive-UI.
* Automatic power ON (raspberry *and* tablet) when AC plug is connected.
* Automatic tablet power off when AC plug is disconnected.
* Clean raspberry shutdown, no more SD corruption/failed boot.
* Power ON and clean shutdown with the ATM door closed.

**WARNING:** libreATM uses 2 "free" android apps that are not software libre (Kiosk and AutoPowerOff)

## Known Bugs ##

### UI ###
* Infinite loading circle.
* Cancel button does not appear complete.
* User can choose from several languages but English is the only one that works.

### System ###
* Automatic USB tethering on boot does not work yet.
